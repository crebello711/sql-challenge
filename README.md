# sql-challenge

In this challenge, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

1. Data Modeling and Data Engineering

   ### To download [Database Design Diagram](EmployeeSQL/QuickDBD-export.png).
   
   ### The ```Table schemata``` is located here [schemaQuery.sql](EmployeeSQL/DataAnalysis/schemaQuery.sql)


2.  Data Analysis

   * List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary
   * List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986
   * List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name
